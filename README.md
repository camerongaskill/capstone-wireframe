This project is called Pocket Mechanic. 

The user is able to go on and self-diagnosis a problem of their car through a series of yes or no questions.

After going through the form answering questions, the user is shown a list of possible problems.

The user then selects a specific article from the list to read more in depth and from that use that knowlege
to research further on how to repaire themselve, or take to a mechanic and ensure they are not to be taken 
advantage of.

This repo contains the html and css files of the projected design of the project.

The final project will be restructured in React and will be functional with a working api to 
recieve the information.
